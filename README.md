## Yo!

After taking the suggested Git course, I learned how to create and merge branches. I also learned the difference between 'cherry-pick' and 'rebase' commands. With a great interactive display of Git's work, the material has become much more accessible and easy to understand. In general, I liked getting new knowledge that will definitely come in handy.
